# aws-s3-storage-microservice

I implemented this project to handle assets storage for my [Benvis](https://github.com/mohsen-d/Benvis) project and probably other projects in the future.

# Stack

It's built over Node.js, TypeScript, Vercel Serverless Functions and AWS S3 SDKs.

# Usage

To use it, you need to

- Have/Create [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) accounts
- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies
- Set environment variables
- Run `vercel dev` to run the project
